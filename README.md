SearchCred is a utility that allows you to search for default credentials.

## Installation

Clone this repository, and simply run `install.sh`. This will copy searchcred to `/usr/bin/` and run the update command. The update command downloads default credentials and store them in `/usr/share/searchcred/`.

## Updating
